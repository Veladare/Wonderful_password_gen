# The Wonderful password generator


## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a password generator that produced a password within a given criteria on a webpage.

In completing this project, I improved my understanding of how if statements operate, how to use booleans in order to set a password citeria for users to chose how to customize their password, and how to give users the opportunity to restart the process if they discover the password is not to their liking, without having to refresh the browser.
